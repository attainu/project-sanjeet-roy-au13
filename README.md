Junk File Organizer with Python
Basically, as a lazy programmer my desktop is full of files (Junk Files). Due to the large number of files, it is a daunting task to sit and organize each file. To make that task easy the below Python script comes handy and all the files are organized in a well-manner within seconds.

for using without any outside library installed, download this file and use it
Main functionality of this code
Organize by extension
Organize by size
Organize by last used date
How to use this::
firstly you have to copy the main.py file to the directory which you want to Organize
After executing the Python file i.e main.py you will see 3 Options thats are 
1. For Organize with extension
press 1

2. For organize with size
press2

3.For organize with last used date
press 3

1. Organize by extension
by using this option user can organize their files by their file extension in a given folder, folder will be created according to file extension and finally all files will be moved to a created folder.

2. Organize by size
by using this option user can organize their files by their file size, according to file sizes it will move to one perticular folder i.e by_size

3. Organize by Last used/accessed date
by using this option user can organize their files by last used date. files will be moved to a folder.i.e by_date

what i used :
I used many built-in libraries like- os for managing file operations datetime to get the date of the files and etc.

future improvement:
We can design the ui for the program so a normal user can easily interact with it. We can add more features like deleting the junk files after a certain period of time.

Note:If you Donot have Python installed in your system just run main.exe file(for windows user only) to execute the program
